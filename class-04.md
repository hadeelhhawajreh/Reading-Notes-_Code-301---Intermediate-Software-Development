Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

``  display: grid;``

ou can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:

+ grid-column-gap
- grid-row-gap
+ grid-gap

Example
The grid-column-gap property sets the gap between the columns:

``.grid-container {``
``  display: grid;``
 `` grid-column-gap: 50px;``
``}``

The grid-gap property can also be used to set both the row gap and the column gap in one value:


``.grid-container {``
``  display: grid;``
 `` grid-gap: 50px;``
``}``

The grid-template-columns Property
The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.

The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the respective column.

If you want your grid layout to contain 4 columns, specify the width of the 4 columns, or "auto" if all columns should have the same width.

Example
Make a grid with 4 columns:

``.grid-container {``
``  display: grid;``
 ``   grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto;``
``}``

The justify-content Property
The justify-content property is used to align the whole grid inside the container.

Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters). Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping
